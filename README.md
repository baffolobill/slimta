About
=====

`slimta` is a configurable MTA based on the `python-slimta` libraries. While
the purpose of the `python-slimta` library is to avoid configuration files and
allow full control via Python code, the `slimta` project recognizes that not
everyone will want or need that level of control.

The `slimta` project is released under the [MIT License][2].
